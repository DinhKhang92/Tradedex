He gave me a deck of cards and told me to give my best, and I did - I finished 2nd in Berlin. My deck was based on Scyther, which was pretty fast paced and came with enormous power. We played a lot, he took me to local card shops, I had intense matches with owners, with strangers and we made new friends.",
            "DESCRIPTION_04": "'Mewtwo strikes back' was my first movie ever in the theaters. Pokémon red was my first game on the gameboy console. Time flew and in June 2016 Pokémon Go was launched in Germany. I started the lvl 40 journey and it took me almost two years to fill the 20m exp bar. During that time I met a lot of cool trainers and an ever-expanding community emerged. Currently we are 800+ people in our local group. Therefore I want to thank you all for letting me be part of the community."
